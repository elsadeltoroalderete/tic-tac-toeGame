# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## What's this project about?
This project is about creating a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using React and Bootstrap.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download two files:
   ·  standalone.html
   ·  tictactoeGame.jsx
- Notice that the standalone.html file is where your React app will be loaded inside the root element, also where the "tictactoeGame.jsx" is being linked.
- The tictactoeGame.jsx file is the main component of your React application. This is where most of the code goes.
- Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root , which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the directory where you save the files)
- Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
- Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser
- Also, you may need a local server to test the application, so in the terminal, in the directory where you save these files, run the command "npx serve" to get you own http server, which is commonly the http://localhost:3000/
  
## What's next?
There's some features that can be improved in this game:
- Add a button to start again the game and reset the board
- Add a counter of how many times has winned Player X and Player O, that resets when the page is reloaded
- Make the letter X and O bigger so they almost fill the size of the square
